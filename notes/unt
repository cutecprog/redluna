Characters have emotions based on Plutnik's emotional wheel. Maybe prioritized
motivations and/or a rating of how well they know these priorities. That's
probably to general and it makes sense that people would act somewhat one
dimensional to a child.

The main substance of a character is their set of knowledge and to a more minor
degree their manner of speaking. They would then have their relationships to
others (most likely only coming into play at the end). If they feel they had a
part in the plague. Their current emotional state which would effect how they
are currently talking to you and possibly also be an active mechcanic throughout
the end. And finally other motives.

Their will be many how-to's (with variations) written in simple english used in
generating a character's knowledge. Character don't have anything like wisedom:
that isn't within the scope of this game. A character's manner of speaking a key
part of the knowledge generation process.

Maybe combine manner of speaking and mood. Meaning that a character's mood is
constant and likely just depression. Some characters happy to talk of their
know-how and others just annoyed. Characters relationship with you can change in
various ways and the more they like you the more they'll tell you.

Overall the villages will share a base procedurally generated manner of
speaking. The foriegner is your adoptive parent. He's been taking care of you
for something like half a year. He speaks english instead of anglish and the
rational here is that you'll pick up on his fancy dialect and he's been teaching
you things. Now that you are fully recovered from the plague (the only one to do
so) he thinks it best if you start interacting more with the rest of the village
because he will be moving on soon and you must find a place.

He will also serve as a basic tutorial of how to interact with people and be a
source for more science and mathy information.

Okay game is procedurally generated within the structure of a village that just
went through a plague and game will end in a witch hunt. Your play as a curious,
orphaned child trying to find his or her place in the remaining village. Most
conversations with be of a informational nature and there will be emphasized
words that you can ask about. You can ask what any word means and depending on
the person they may define it. The evidence and information you may need to calm
the hysteria at the end of the game or to help determine the witch will not be
things obvious but might be emphasized text. The actual set of living people and
cause of the epidemic will be what is procedural generated has well has what
technics people use for their trade.

Their will always be a scientifically minded foriegner who after hearing word of
the epidemic came to study it and help those inflicted. He or she is most likely
to be the victem of the witch hunt. In some games it may just be that the
foriegner knowingly contaminated the village in order to study it. The word
choice of the people in the game will should also be procedurally generated and
should not be telling to who or what done it.

The game will be in Anglish so a first time player will have the vocabulary of
the child they are playing. Also this may disguise the strange lingos generated
procedurally. The game should be easy to mod to change the language of use a 
pigeon to help in learning a language although this won't be an initial feature.
Most lingos for people should be in simplified English with Anglish vocab but
some folk will use more poetic or obfuscated lanaugue.

There isn't a wrong way to play this game or a notable bad ending if you don't
do the right things. This game should be curiousity driven; the game should be a
gamified wiki page with personal narrative. All schedules and choices of
characters are preset at the beginning of the game. While your actions effect
things in minor ways, and you can collect items, the main way you effect people
is by what they think of you. There is a game clock that does run through 
conversations but the majority of the game time that passes actions is not done
in real time (eg walk across the village, or collecting tree bark).

At the start of the witch hunt you actions start mattering a lot and what people
think about you is basically set as well as your ability to collect items. Time
is very limited in this part of the game so conversation will happen very
quickly and there won't be much moving around: at the start of the witch hunt
everything is in real time.

Game can be paused at anytime be pressing ESC: the screen goes black and the
audio stops. The game can be saved at any moment but there can only be one save,
for a given playthrough, and upon loading you are not longer able to load the
save again. The game should have a very frequent autosave and therefore ability
to minimize the effect of a game crash.
