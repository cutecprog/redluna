You're in a strange land now. You speak the empiral language but here they don't
seem to to speak it quite right. A word here and there is intelligable but the
man that is yelling at you registers nothing in your mind.
Will you?
- Move away from him [Fast, cautiously]
- Move toward him [Aggressively, cautiously, causally]
- Focus on his words
- Inspect your area [In front and behind him, on either side of him]
- Inspect the man

Inspect, focus on, look at, listen to, ....

Okay game is procedurally generated within the structure of a village that just
went through a plague and game will end in a witch hunt. Your play as a curious,
orphaned child trying to find his or her place in the remaining village. Most
conversations with be of a informational nature and there will be emphasized
words that you can ask about. You can ask what any word means and depending on
the person they may define it. The evidence and information you may need to calm
the hysteria at the end of the game or to help determine the witch will not be
things obvious but might be emphasized text. The actual set of living people and
cause of the epidemic will be what is procedural generated has well has what
technics people use for their trade.

Their will always be a scientifically minded foriegner who after hearing word of
the epidemic came to study it and help those inflicted. He or she is most likely
to be the victem of the witch hunt. In some games it may just be that the
foriegner knowingly contaminated the village in order to study it. The word
choice of the people in the game will should also be procedurally generated and
should not be telling to who or what done it.

The game will be in Anglish so a first time player will have the vocabulary of
the child they are playing. Also this may disguise the strange lingos generated
procedurally. The game should be easy to mod to change the language of use a 
pigeon to help in learning a language although this won't be an initial feature.
Most lingos for people should be in simplified English with Anglish vocab but
some folk will use more poetic or obfuscated lanaugue.

There isn't a wrong way to play this game or a notable bad ending if you don't
do the right things. This game should be curiousity driven; the game should be a
gamified wiki page with personal narrative. All schedules and choices of
characters are preset at the beginning of the game. While your actions effect
things in minor ways, and you can collect items, the main way you effect people
is by what they think of you. There is a game clock that does run through 
conversations but the majority of the game time that passes actions is not done
in real time (eg walk across the village, or collecting tree bark).

At the start of the witch hunt you actions start mattering a lot and what people
think about you is basically set as well as your ability to collect items. Time
is very limited in this part of the game so conversation will happen very
quickly and there won't be much moving around: at the start of the witch hunt
everything is in real time.

Game can be paused at anytime be pressing ESC: the screen goes black and the
audio stops. The game can be saved at any moment but there can only be one save,
for a given playthrough, and upon loading you are not longer able to load the
save again. The game should have a very frequent autosave and therefore ability
to minimize the effect of a game crash.
